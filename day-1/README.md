# Day 1 Log

## Part 1

Spent almost 3 hours on this, but the majority of that time was spent on getting my repo set up with the right dependencies as well as re-familiarizing myself with the basics of Typescript.
Once I got going with actually writing code, I very quickly saw the benefits of the type-checking that Typescript does. Between that and using the sample data to TDD in Jest, I ran into very few bugs/mistakes and got the right answer on the first try!
